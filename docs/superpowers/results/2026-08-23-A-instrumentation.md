# Phase A results: instrumentation and harness (2026-08-23)

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-23-phase-a-instrumentation.md`
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-23-backlog-completion-design.md` §2

## Step 0 — the baseline

`runs/` was empty at the start of this phase (spec §1.1), so this baseline was
generated rather than cited. Every no-op gate below compares against it.

|---|---|
| Commit | `d8aec0b42b4c1d5c6f14158f7268647baadf7e71` (short `d8aec0b`) |
| Configuration | 2 servers, 400 objects, `uniform`, 1,800 paced ticks, seed 42, `--halo-width 8`, halo reliable, `--drain-seconds 5` |
| Build | Release, via `tools/build-deploy.ps1 -Config Release` |
| Invariants | `analyse.py` exit code 1 — one **INVARIANT FAILURE**: `ticks1800-r1: ownership_gap_ticks = 84 (expected 0)`. Everything else passed: two server CSVs found, `owned` counts 201/199 with 0 mismatch, halo `haloLate=0`/`haloAhead=0` on both servers, `hoFail=0`/`hoReclaimed=0`/`hoDup=0` on both servers. |

**On the ownership-gap failure.** This run used the default `--handoff-lookahead 0`
(not overridden by the Step 3 command), which per `CLAUDE.md` is the case where
"`ScheduleOutgoingObject` releases on send and nobody owns the object for one
network round trip" — a documented, default-behaviour gap, not a regression
introduced by this task. It is recorded here rather than treated as a reason to
re-run: this document's job is to capture what commit `d8aec0b` actually produces
under this exact configuration, so that Task 6's later diff is against a real
baseline rather than an idealised one. Any later run at the same configuration
that reports a materially different `ownership_gap_ticks` is the signal Task 6
exists to catch.

**Working tree at capture time.** `git status --porcelain` was clean before Step 2
(build). Configuring CMake (both the distributed-role pass and the client pass
inside `tools/build-deploy.ps1`) regenerates project files that embed the
configuring machine's absolute paths and CMake-assigned GUIDs, so the tree is
dirty by the time the baseline run executes and `experiment.json` records
`gitDirty: true` / `analyse.py` prints `(DIRTY - not reproducible)`. This is
expected on any machine other than the one the committed files were generated on
and is not addressed here. The four dirty paths, all CMake-generated and none
committed by this task:

- `DistributedPhysicsSystem.sln`
- `DistributedGameServer/DistributedGameServer.vcxproj.filters`
- `DistributedPhysicsManager/DistributedPhysicsManager.vcxproj.filters`
- `PhysicsServerMidware/PhysicsServerMidware.vcxproj.filters`

Task 6's gate compares a baseline run against a post-change run and both are
dirty in the same way from the same regeneration step, so this flag cannot mask
a real difference between the two.

`@@FINAL` lines are stored at `runs/exp-phaseA-baseline/FINAL-baseline.txt`.
